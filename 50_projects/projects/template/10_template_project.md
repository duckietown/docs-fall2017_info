## Problem Statement
Summarize the mission for the team - what needs to be implemented, documented, tested? What is the need that is being addressed? Do not focus on technical specifics yet.

There are two features to implement:
The Duckiebots need to …
This is needed because ...

## Deliverables

Now give an idea of what you are going to implement - so that the other teams are aware of what you are doing. Note that you need some brainstorming/analysis before writing this section. (The sections are not in chronological order).

We need to implement:
The ROS module for ...
The ROS module for …
A testing script
...
We need to also create:
Logs to be used in testing
...
We need to create/upgrade this documentation
Specification of <part of Duckietown being developed>appearance
User manual for the feature
...

Please list here the relevant documents.

Leave these 3 in place; they are relevant for all:

Documentation Style Guide (relevant for all)
The ROS Diagram.  (relevant for all)
Other interesting documents 
Add here links to papers you might happen to use. Youtube videos for inspiration, etc.
Goal
After discussion, please write down here the specifications for the system you are building. Please separate as much as possible “functionality” and “performance”. “Performance” issues are what would disappear if you had a computer with infinite computing power, or a network with infinite bandwidth. “Functionality” are what needs to be coded.

Functionality
What should the system implement?

Performance
What should the performance be?
Current status
Write here the current status. What works now, as opposed to what the goal is. The difference between these two is the work to be done.  

Note: it is better to have something that does not work, and a good description of what should work and why it doesn’t work, than to have something that kinda work, but nobody knows what the thing is supposed to do.

Functionality
Nothing implemented.

Performance
Infinitely slow.
Timeline
Use this section to keep track of the milestones.
