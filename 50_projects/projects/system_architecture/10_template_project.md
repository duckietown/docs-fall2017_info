# System Architecture {#project-template status=beta}

## Preliminaries

Name of Project: System Architecture

Team:
  - Sonja Brits (Zurich) (System architect)
  - Andrea Censi (Zurich) (Mentor/Supervisor)

Slack channel: #devel-heroes

Software development branch: sonja-devel

## Problem Statement


## Relevant Resources

List papers, open source code, pages in the Duckiebook, lecture slides, etc, that could be relevant in your quest. 

## Deliverables (Goals)

Anything that is going to be an output. These should be quantified in terms of functionalities and performance metrics where appropriate.

Example 1: A Duckiebot detection system (functionality) with minimum precision of 0.8, a minimum recall of 0.5, a maximum latency of 50ms with maximum CPU consumption of 80% of one core (performance).

Example 2: At least 20 hours of logs Duckiebots annotated

Part of the deliverables should be: 

1. A new or improved functionality (demonstrated live and with a video) with well-documented code, 
2. A approx 15-20min presentation about the functionality (with a slide deck + 1 slide overview poster to be shown at public demo),
3. A technical description of the underlying method in the form of a page in the Duckiebook, 
4. Instructions for reproducing the functionality in the form of a page in the duckiebook. 


## Proposed Approach

After analysis of the resources and precise understanding of the problem you trying to solve, make a plan for how you will solve the problem. It is possible that at the start you could explore several seemingly promising avenues. However, you should converge on Bronze standard before moving to Silver standard etc.

## Logging and Testing Procedure

A detailed description of the logs and procedure you will use to verify that the system is working the way you say it is working. In most cases this should include a **regression** test so that when someone changes something else, we can make sure that your thing still works as well as it used to.

## Current status

Write here the current status. What works now, as opposed to what the goal is. The difference between these two is the work to be done.

Note: it is better to have something that does not work, and a good description of what should work and why it doesnâ€™t work, than to have something that kinda works, but nobody knows what the thing is supposed to do.

### Functionality

Nothing implemented.

### Performance

Infinitely slow.


## Tasks

So and so should do such and such

## Timeline

 - This should be done by Nov 15
 - That shoudl be done by Nov 16
