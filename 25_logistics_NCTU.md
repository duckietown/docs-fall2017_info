Classes take place on Thursday from 1:20pm~4:20om in NCTU Engineering Building 5 Room 635. Each class will be devided into two sessoins. In the first session, Professor Wang will give lessons on foundamental theory and inspire students to come up more creatitive but useful ideas on final projects. In the second sessoin, TAs will give pratical lab on how to use Duckietown platform as their project platform and use ROS as their middleware toward a fantastic work. 

The class schedule is maintained as part of the [NCTU Class Diary](#schedule_NCTU), which includes details on lecture topics, links to slides, etc.

### Course Grading

The following is taken from the [course syllabus](https://goo.gl/KPQQHL):

This course aims at developing software projects usable in real-world, and focuses on "learning by doing," "team work," and "research/startup oriented.". The contribution of each to your overall grade is as follows:

* Class Participation, In Class Quiz, Problem Sets (10%)
* Midterm Presentation (30%)
* Final Presentation (30%) 
* Project Report and Demo Video (30%) 

See the [course syllabus](https://goo.gl/KPQQHL) for more information on course object and grading policy.

### Policy on Late Assignments and Collaboration

The following is taken from the [course syllabus](http://duckietown.org/classes/2017/17-TTIC/syllabus/):

Late problem sets will be penalized 10% for each day that they are
late. Those submitted more than three days beyond their due date will
receive no credit.

Each student has a budget of three days that they can use to avoid late penalties. It is up to the student to decide when/how they use these days (i.e., all at once or individually). Students must identify whether and how many days they use when they submit an assignment.

It is not acceptable to use code or solutions from outside class
(including those found online), unless the resources are specifically
suggested as part of the problem set.

You are encouraged to collaborate through study groups and to discuss
problem sets and the project in person and over Slack. However, you must
acknowledge who you worked with on each problem set. You must write up
and implement your own solutions and are not allowed to duplicate efforts. The correct approach is to discuss solution strategies, credit your collaborator, and write your solutions individually. Solutions that are too similar will be
penalized.


### Lab Access

Duckietown labs will take place at NCTU in the same place with the lecture.

**Note**: The course focus on "learning by doing" which means that the lab session of each class is expectially important.
