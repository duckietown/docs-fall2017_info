# Logistics for Chicago branch {#logistics_TTIC status=ready}

Assigned: Matt

This section describes information specific to TTIC and UChicago students.

### Website

The [course website](http://duckietown.org/classes/2017/17-TTIC/) provides a copy of the syllabus, grading information, and details on learning objectives.


### Class Schedule

Classes take place on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9am-11am in TTIC Room 530. In practice, each class will be divided into an initial lecture period (approximately one hour), followed by a lab session.

The class schedule is maintained as part of the [TTIC Class Diary](#schedule_TTIC), which includes details on lecture topics, links to slides, etc.

### Course Grading

The following is taken from the [course syllabus](http://duckietown.org/classes/2017/17-TTIC/syllabus/):

The class will assess your grasp of the material through a combination
of problem sets, exams, and a final project. The contribution of each
to your overall grade is as follows:

* 20%: Problem sets
* 10%: Checkoffs
* 20%: Participation
* 50%: Final project (includes report and presentation). The projects will be group-based, but we will assess the contribution of each student individually.

See the [course syllabus](http://duckietown.org/classes/2017/17-TTIC/syllabus/) for more information on how the participation and final project grades are determined.

### Policy on Late Assignments and Collaboration

The following is taken from the [course syllabus](http://duckietown.org/classes/2017/17-TTIC/syllabus/):

Late problem sets will be penalized 10% for each day that they are
late. Those submitted more than three days beyond their due date will
receive no credit.

Each student has a budget of three days that they can use to avoid late penalties. It is up to the student to decide when/how they use these days (i.e., all at once or individually). Students must identify whether and how many days they use when they submit an assignment.

It is not acceptable to use code or solutions from outside class
(including those found online), unless the resources are specifically
suggested as part of the problem set.

You are encouraged to collaborate through study groups and to discuss
problem sets and the project in person and over Slack. However, you must
acknowledge who you worked with on each problem set. You must write up
and implement your own solutions and are not allowed to duplicate efforts. The correct approach is to discuss solution strategies, credit your collaborator, and write your solutions individually. Solutions that are too similar will be
penalized.


### Lab Access

Duckietown labs will take place at TTIC in the robotics lab on the 4th floor.

**Note**: TTIC and U. Chicago students in Matthew Walter's research group use the lab as their exclusive research and office space. It also houses several robots and hardware to support them. Please respect the space when you use it: try not to distract lab members while they are working and please don't touch the robots, sensors, or tools.

### The Local LAs

Duckietown is a collaborative effort involving close interaction among students, TAs, mentors, and faculty across several institutions. The local learning assistants (LAs) at TTIC are:

* Andrea F. Daniele (afdaniele@ttic.edu)
* Falcon Dai (dai@ttic.edu)
* Jon Michaux (jmichaux@ttic.edu)
