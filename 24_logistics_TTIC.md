# Guide for TTIC students {#logistics_TTIC status=ready}

Assigned: Matt

This section describes information specific to TTIC and U. Chicago students.

### Website

The [course website](http://duckietown.org/classes/2017/17-TTIC/) provides a copy of the syllabus, grading information, and details on learning objectives.


### Class Schedule

Classes take place on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9am-11am in TTIC Room 530. In practice, each class will be divided into an initial lecture period (approximately one hour), followed by a lab session.

The class schedule is maintained as part of the [TTIC Class Diary](#schedule_TTIC), which includes details on lecture topics, links to slides, etc.

### Lab Access

Duckietown labs will take place at TTIC in the robotics lab on the 4th floor.

**Note**: TTIC and U. Chicago students in Matthew Walter's research group use the lab as their exclusive research and office space. It also houses several robots and hardware to support them. Please respect the space when you use it: try not to distract lab members while they are working and please don't touch the robots, sensors, or tools.

### The Local LAs

Duckietown is a collaborative effort involving close interaction among students, TAs, mentors, and faculty across several institutions. The local learning assistants (LAs) at TTIC are:

* Andrea F. Daniele (afdaniele@ttic.edu)
