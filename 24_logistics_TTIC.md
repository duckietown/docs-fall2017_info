### Lab access

Duckietown labs will take place in the XXX conference room.

**Note**: \\Prof. Sadaoki, the TTIC President, generously offered to let us use his conference as our lab space during the quarter. It is essential that we take care of the room and leave it in the same condition that we found it in. Please be aware that Prof. Sadaoki may ask us to not use the space for a few hours at a time during meetings.
