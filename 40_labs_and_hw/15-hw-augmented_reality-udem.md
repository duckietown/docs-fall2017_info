## Follow the git policy for homeworks

See: [](#git-policy-homeworks)

for instructions on how the homework should be submitted.


## Exercise: Augmented Reality

Complete [](#exercise-augmented-reality)

Note that you should do a pull in `Software` to get all the goodies and utils described in the exercise,  and ``exercises-fall2017` repos (in exercises-fall2017 repo this means pulling from the **duckietown** remote:

    $ git pull upstream master

if you have followed the instructions properly.

In the `exercises-fall2017` repository, you will find a template that you can use to make your own packae. Basically everywhere you see `littleredcorvette` you would need to replace it with your ![robot_name].


## Bonus: Defining the intersection_4way.yaml

The first student to do it (from any institution) gets notoriety and a bonus.
