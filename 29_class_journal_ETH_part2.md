## Sep 28: some announcements {#Zurich-2017-09-28}

A couple of announcements:

1. We created `#ethz-chitchat` for questions and other random things, so that we can leave this channel #ethz-announcements only for announcements.

2. MyStudies should be updated with everybody's names.

3. The "lab" time tomorrow consists in an empty room for you to use as you wish, for example to assemble the robots together. In particular, it's on the same floor of the Duckietown room and the IDSC lab.

4. The instructions for assembling the Duckiebots are [here](#building-duckiebot-c0). Note that we did for you step I-2 (buying the parts) and I-3 (soldering the boards); and I-6 is optional.

5. We are happy if we see everybody reaching I-13 by the Monday after next. I encourage you to start sooner than later.

6. I see only 30 people in this channel instead of 42. Please tell your friends that now all the action is on Slack.


## Oct 01 (Mon): Announcement {#Zurich-2017-10-01 status=ready}

It looks like that the current documentation is misleading in a couple of points.  This is partially due to the fact that there is some divergence between Chicago, Montreal and Zurich regarding (1) the parts given out and (2) the setup environment (which networks are available). We did the simple changes (e.g. removing the infamous part 6), but we need some more time to review the other issues. At this point, the best course of action is that you enjoy your weekend without working on Duckietown, while we spend the weekend fixing the documentation.
