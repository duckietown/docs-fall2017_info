## Wednesday, September 27: Duckiebox Ceremony

Welcome to Duckietown! This lecture constitutes the _Duckiebox ceremony_ during which we will distribute your Duckieboxes and ask you to name your yet-to-be built Duckiebots! We will also discuss logistics related to the course, but we admit that that isn't as exciting.


### Lecture Content

* [The Duckiebook](http://book.duckietown.org/fall2017/duckiebook/index.html)
* Slack ([](#slack_channels))
* Git repos ([](#fall2017-git))
* How to get and give help ([](#help))
* [](#checkoff_assembly_configuration) initiated
* Getting to know one another
* Naming your robots
* Distribute the Duckieboxes!


As you name your Duckiebots, please consider the following constraints:

- The name must work as a hostname. It needs to start with a letter, contains only letters and numbers, and no spaces or punctuation.
- It should be short, easy to type. (You'll type it a lot.)
- It cannot be your own name.
- It cannot be a generic name like "robot", "duckiebot", "car". It cannot contain brand names.
