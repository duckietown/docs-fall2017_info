# General remarks

Assigned: Andrea

This is the first time that a class is taught jointly across 3 continents!

There are 4 universities involved in the joint teaching for the term:

- ETH ZÃ¼rich (ETHZ), with instructors Emilio Frazzoli, Andrea Censi, Jacopo Tani.
- University of Montreal (UdeM), with instructor Liam Paull.
- TTI-Chicago (TTIC), with instructor Matthew Walter.
- National C T University (NCTU), with instructor Nick Wang.

This part of the Duckiebook describes all the information that is needed
by the students of the four institutions.


## The rules of Duckietown

**The first rule of Duckietown**

The first rule of Duckietown is: you don't talk about Duckietown, *using email*.

Instead, we use a communication platform called Slack.

There is one exception: inquiries about "meta" level issues, such as course
enrollment and other official bureaucratic issues can be communicated via email.

**The second rule of Duckietown**

The second rule of Duckietown is: be kind and respectful, and have
fun.

**The third rule of Duckietown**

The third rule of Duckietown is: read the instructions carefully.

Do not blindly copy and paste.

Only run a command if you know what it does.


## Synchronization between classes

At ETHZ, UdeM, TTIC, the class will be more-or-less synchronized. The materials
are the same; there is some slight variation in the ordering.

Moreover, there will be some common groups for the projects.

The NCTU class is undergraduate level. Students will learn slightly simplified materials. They will not collaborate directly with the classes.


## Accounts for students

To participate in Duckietown, students must use two accounts: Slack
and Github.
