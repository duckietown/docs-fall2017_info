The sheet called "Activity Tracker" describes specific tasks that you must do
in a certain sequence.  Tasks include things like "assemble your robot"
or "sign up on Github".

The difference between the Areas sheet and the Task sheet is that
the Task sheet contains tasks that you have to do once; instead,
the Areas sheet contains ongoing activities.

In this sheet, each task is a row, and each person is a column. There is one
column for each person in the class, including instructors, TAs, mentors, and
students.

You have two options:

- Only use the sheet as a reference;
- Use the sheet actively to track your progress. To do this,
send a message to Kirsten with your gmail address, and add yourself.

Each task in the first column is linked to the documentation
that describes how to perform the task.


The colored boxes have the following meaning:

- Grey: not ready. This means the task is not ready for you to start yet.
- Red: not started. The person has not started the task.
- Blue: in progress. The person is doing the task.
- Yellow: blocked. The person is blocked.
- Green: done. The person is done with the task.
- n/a: the task is not applicable to the person. (Certain tasks are staff-only.)

<!-- If there is a problem for a task, please add a comment, and in the comment
explain the problem. If the problem is solved, remember to remove the comment. -->

<!-- Students do not have (at least for now) editing access to the spreadsheet.
Therefore, it's the TAs that periodically update the spreadsheet.

At any time, if a student has a blocking problem with a task, they (or the TA) should add a comment to the corresponding cell. This is our "ticket system" - if students
put a comment, we'll make sure that their issue is resolved.

## The  Areas sheet  {#org-sheets}


Please familiarize yourself with [this spreadsheet][areas] and bookmark it
in your browser.

The sheet called "Areas" describes the points of contact for
each part of this experience. These are the people that
can offer support. In particular, note that we list two points of contact:
one for America, and one for Europe. Moreover, there is a link
to a Slack channel, which is the place where to ask for help. (We'll get you
started on Slack in just a minute.)

<!-- (Later in the class, when you are all set up and running, we will
ask you to use tools like Github Issues to ask for help; in this
onboarding phase, you only need to care about Slack.) -->
