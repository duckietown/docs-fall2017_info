# Guide for TAs

## First steps

Here are the first steps:

* Watch the Duckumentary.

* Sign up on our online accounts. The guides are Kirsten. These include:

    - Personal Github account
    - Being part of the Duckietown Github organization, and the TA team.
    - Twist
    - Slack

* Start learning about Git and Github. You don't have to read the entirety of the following references now, but keep them "on your desk" for later reference.

See: [Good book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

See: [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

TODO: find reference about continuous integration.

* Install the Duckuments, so you can edit these instructions.

See: [](#contribute).

* Build your Duckiebot according to the instructions.

See: [](#building-duckiebot)

As you read the instructions, keep open the Duckuments source, and note any
discrepancy. You must note any unexpected thing that is not predicted from the
instruction. If you don't understand anything, please note it.

The idea is that dozens of other people will have to do the same after you, so
improving the documentation is the best use of your time, and it is much more
inefficient than answering the same question dozens of times.

* Familiarize yourself with the organization chart. This is where we assign areas of responsibility.
