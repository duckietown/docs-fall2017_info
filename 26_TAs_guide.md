### Learn about Git and Github

Start learning about Git and Github. You don't have to read the entirety of the
following references now, but keep them "on your desk" for later reference.

See: [Good book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

See: [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

### Duckiebot building

Build your Duckiebot according to the instructions.

As you read the instructions, keep open the Duckuments source, and note any
discrepancy. You must note any unexpected thing that is not predicted from the
instruction. If you don't understand anything, please note it.

The idea is that dozens of other people will have to do the same after you, so
improving the documentation is the best use of your time, and it is much more
inefficient than answering the same question dozens of times.

### Organization chart

Familiarize yourself with the organization chart. This is where we assign areas
of responsibility.
