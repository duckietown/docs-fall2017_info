### Questions and answers

Q: What version of Linux do I need to install?

A: 16.04.* (16.04.03 is the latest at time of this writing)

Q: My laptop is not ready. I'm having problems installing Linux on a partition.

A: Don't worry, take a Duckie, and breath. We have time to fix every issue. Start by asking for help in the #help-laptops channel in Slack. We will address the outstanding issues in the next classes.  

Q: How much space do I need on my Linux partition?

A: $\geq$50GB. $\geq$ 200GB are recommended for easy processing of data (logs) later in the course. If you have less space (say ~100GB), it might be wise to put your hands on an external hard drive to use as storage.

Q: Are there going to be Linux training sessions?

A: Maybe. Subject to figuring out the logistics, we might organize an extra "lab" session or produce a support video.


## Monday Sep 25, late: Onboarding instructions {status=ready}


At some late hour of the night, we sent out the onboarding instructions.

See: [](#onboarding-fall2017)

**Please complete the onboarding questionnaire by Tuesday, September 26, 15:00.**



## Wednesday Sep 27: Duckiebox distribution and group intro

Today we distribute the Duckieboxes and we name the robots.

Note: If you cannot make it to this class for the Duckiebox distribution, please inform the TA.

### Preparation: choose a name for your robot {#1709-duckieboxes}

Before arriving to class, you must think of a name for your robot.

Here are the constraints:

- The name must work as a hostname. It needs to start with a letter, contains only letters and numbers, and no spaces or punctuation.
- It should be short, easy to type. (You'll type it a lot.)
- It cannot be your own name.
- It cannot be a generic name like "robot", "duckiebot", "car". It cannot contain brand names.


### Material presented in class
