### Questions and answers

Q: What version of Linux do I need to install?

A: 16.04.* (16.04.03 is the latest at time of this writing)

Q: My laptop is not ready. I'm having problems installing Linux on a partition.

A: Don't worry, take a Duckie, and, take a breath. We have time to fix every issue. Start by asking for help in the #help-laptops channel in Slack. We will address the outstanding issues in the next classes.

Q: How much space do I need on my Linux partition?

A: $\geq$50GB. $\geq$ 200GB are recommended for easy processing of data (logs) later in the course. If you have less space (say ~100GB), it might be wise to acquire an external hard drive to use as storage.

Q: Are there going to be Linux training sessions?

A: Maybe. We didn't plan for it, but it seems that there is a need.
Subject to figuring out the logistics, we might organize an extra "lab" session or produce a support video.

## Wednesday Sep 27: Duckiebox distribution, and getting to know each other {#2017-09-27-duckieboxes}

Goals for today:

- getting to know each other;
- naming the robots;
- distribute the Duckieboxes.

Note: If you cannot make it to this class for the Duckiebox distribution, please inform the TA, to schedule

### Preparation: choose a name for your robot {#1709-duckieboxes}

- It should be short, easy to type. (You'll type it a lot.)
- It cannot be your own name.
- It cannot be a generic name like "robot", "duckiebot", "car". It cannot contain brand names.
